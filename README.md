# Analytics-Models-Final-Project

This final project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data/?select=train.csv) to classify pasengers on the Titanic as survived or not survived. It merges the test.csv, train.csv, and gender_submission.csv datasets to use with many classification datasets. The project uses a K-nearest neighbors model, basing predictions on the 13 nearest neighbors. It also uses a decision tree, adjusting the maximum depth and random state.
